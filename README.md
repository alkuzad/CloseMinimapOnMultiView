# Background

This script used to be very hacky with a cache save, and then mighty dev Build 3116 came:

`API: Added functions to get/set the minimap, status bar, tabs and menu`

Hurray, no more hacking :)

# How it works ?

Automatically - just install and whenever you split window to more than 1 views - minimap will close. Go back to single mode and it will show up.

# TODO

1. Still no detection of desired state though - if user started with minimap switched off - it will show back :)
